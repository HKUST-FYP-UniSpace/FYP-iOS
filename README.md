> Commission-free mobile platform with algorithm-based suggestions

**UniSpace**, is particularly designed for university students. It is a commission-free mobile platform to help students find off-campus accommodations without going through real estate agents. It provides choices and suggestions for the students to select both their preferred locations and roommates for the rental and trade unwanted furniture and daily necessities to achieve environmentally friendly.

The initiative of this project is to provide university students with a more convenient way to form rental-related deals in a bid to unload their housing burden. The ultimate vision is to create a one-stop shop for the university community to communicate regarding their accommodation needs and quickly access solutions of to their needs.

## Installation

CocoaPods is built with Ruby and it will be installable with the default Ruby available on macOS. You can use a Ruby Version manager, however we recommend that you use the standard Ruby available on macOS unless you know what you're doing.

Using the default Ruby install will require you to use `sudo` when installing gems. (This is only an issue for the duration of the gem installation, though.)

```shell
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

If you encounter any problems during installation, please visit [this](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/troubleshooting#installing-cocoapods) guide.

### Updating CocoaPods

> To update CocoaPods you simply install the gem again

```shell
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
```

> Or for a pre-release version

```shell
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods --pre
```

If you originally installed the cocoapods gem using `sudo`, you should use that command again.

Later on, when you're actively using CocoaPods by installing pods, you will be notified when new versions become available with a *CocoaPods X.X.X is now available, please update* message.
